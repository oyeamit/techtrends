## TechTrends - *Project Overview*

TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them with the wider community. In this project, I have taken the role of a platform engineer with the main role to package and deploy the application to a Kubernetes platform. Throughout this project, I have used Docker to package the application, and automated the Continuous Integration process with GitHub Actions. For the release process, I have used Kubernetes declarative manifests, which were templated using Helm. To automated the Continuous Delivery process, I have used ArgoCD.
